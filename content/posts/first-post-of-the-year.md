Writing more frequently has been one of my commonly unfulfilled new year's
resolutions for the past few years. With this blog finally set up (hurray
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)!), I'm hoping to finally stick to this year's goal
and write with a little more frequency, one post at a time. I'm a little over
a month behind with starting on a new year's resolution but better late than
never! Here's to new beginnings and more writing in 2018!
