Hello, my name is Divya. I'm a developer with a passion for the web and all
things Open Source. I've been spending most of my time on the front end of
things and have come to appreciate the quirks of JavaScript and its many
frameworks.

Currently, I'm a developer at a startup called [Lucro](http://getlucro.com/)
where I'm building financial modelling software to help real estate investors
with their underwriting. Before that, I worked at a smattering of companies
building websites for mid to large scale client projects and story-telling
apps/tools for journalists. In my free time, I'm an avid rock climber and
cyclist.

I'm not looking for a new position at the moment. However, if you want to talk
shop or chat about rock climbing or bicycles, hit me up at **_hello [at]
